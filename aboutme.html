            <p>I built on this initial interest in a 4-month UX class at San Francisco General assembly. I was excited
                to better understand the significant overlap between UX design and architecture. The design thinking
                process is identical. During the UX courses, I often found myself coaching people in my class on design
                theory and graphic design and teaching them design software (e.g. Photoshop and Illustrator). There are
                three key strengths that I would bring to the team as a product designer:</p>

            <p> BIM technology: I have 10+ years of experience as project and office BIM lead. Revit is currently the
                software that dominates the design and construction industry. I became an Autodesk Certified Revit
                Professional in 2012 and have been managing the teamâ€™s BIM workflow. I am responsible for the
                collaboration with GC and MEP during the design and construction phases. I believe the understanding of
                Revit and BIM team workflow will provide important insights when it comes to developing new products for
                this industry. I think there are numerous opportunities to tap into the data that is built in BIM, and
                both MEP and GC can benefit greatly from it.</p>


            <p> Construction Administration: While I have a great passion for design, at the early stage of my career, I
                intentionally requested to be working on the technical side. Being a job captain/PA, I have gained a
                wealth of knowledge in construction. Working closely with GCs and engineers, I am exposed to a very
                different aspect of the design industry. CA is a very process-focused and time-consuming task. It
                continues to be a major pain point for many companies, and I have not seen a good solution to tackle
                this challenge. There are significant opportunities for improvement that PlanGrid can bring to the
                industry. I would be excited to bring to life ideas for improvement that could help both GCs and
                architects that I developed while encountering the daily challenges of my CA work.</p>

            <p>Cross discipline collaboration: Another aspect of my daily workflow is to collaborating with GC and MEP
                to create design solutions that are timely, have constructability and are budget friendly. It is always
                a struggle for designers to communicate design intentions and ideas over 2 dimensional drawings. I was
                able to utilize my skill in BIM to find effective ways to collaborate with GC and MEP. I thrive in a
                multi discipline environment with opportunities to learn quickly, tackle problems and come up with
                elegant solutions. Being a designer not only requires a good sense of aesthetics but also the ability to
                understand the psychology behind the design intention, which is particularly important when it comes to
                collaborating with MEP and GC. </p>
